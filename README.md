# Writing Beginner Smart Contracts on Solana with Rust and Moralis


0.	Before we can write or deploy a smart contract to Solana, we need to set up our development environment. This tutorial implies that you are using a unix (MacOS or Linux) based machine. 
    -	Our first step is to install rust, the native programming language and suite of tools that Solana utilizes. Rust can be installed by running the following “curl” command in your terminal. A prompt will appear asking you to choose between options `1. proceed with installation`, `2. customize installation` and `3. cancel installation`.
  ```
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
